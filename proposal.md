# Title - Dancing Rainbow GIF

## Repository
https://github.com/Bethany-Bufanda/Final_Project.git

## Description
I will draw the required frames for a gif style dancing animation with a color changing background. The animation will also have a functional resize bar.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Dancing character - Glob - 
- Feature 2
	- Resize bar - pygame - RESIZABLE
- Feature N 
	- Color changing background - turtle - time -- RGB

## Challenges
- How to get the background to change color.
- How to make sure the background of the character is transparent so the color changing background can be seen. 
- How to get the resize bar to function correctly - I was unable to in my rain animation.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The character animation will be smooth and you will be able to see the color changing background in a smooth loop. Also, the box containing the animation will have a functional resize bar.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- For the dancing character to be operating in a smooth loop that can be x'd out of.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create frames for animation.
  2. Create code to insert frames with necessary transparency - get the animation functioning at some level.

- Week 2
  1. Create the color changing background.
  2. Make functioning resize bar.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Final debugging
  2. Submission
